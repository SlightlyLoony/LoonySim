/**
 * Implements {@link Vector} based on a compressed vector representation that is especially suited for the sorts of sparse vectors found in circuit
 * simulations, where vectors may be several thousands of entries long, but are under 50% populated (and often as little as 1%).
 *
 * implementation: Red/black tree with two longs per node.  First long has two child indexes (shorts), column index value for this node (short), plus
 * one bit for color (49 bits total).  Second long has raw bits for the double value of this node.  This format "wastes" 15 bits per entry.  Store
 * blocks of "n" nodes in fixed size long arrays.  Store an array of these block arrays, allocated as needed.  Keep a linked list of empty nodes in
 * the empty nodes themselves, and allocate new nodes from them first.  Only when that list is empty allocate from end of block.
 *
 * note on matrix version: use a double store that allocates stores within an expandable array of blocks, much as in the nodes for TreeVector.  Then
 * make separate index red/black trees for an RC index and a CR index (thus allowing fast enumeration of either nonzero columns within a row, or
 * rows within a column).  The data in these red/black trees will be keys into the double store, which need to be 24 bits long.  That means the
 * indices for the rows and columns need to be 12 bits long (we're assuming almost square matrices).  So a node needs two child indices (24 bits
 * each), a R or C index (12 bits), a value key (24 bits), and a color (1 bit).  That adds up to 85 bits, too big for one long, quite wasteful (43
 * bits per node) with two longs.  It could be implemented with 3 ints, wasting 11 bits per node.
