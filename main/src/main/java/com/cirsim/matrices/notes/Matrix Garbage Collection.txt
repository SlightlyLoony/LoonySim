Matrix Garbage Collection

Some implementations of Matrix may accumulate significant disused memory when the number of entries grows and then shrinks (as during Gaussian
elimination).  In effect, they need some kind of garbage collection.  In some cases (such as TreeMap), any way I could think of to implement either
continuous or automatic garbage collection would be painfully slow, and would also impact normal performance.

This leads me to the conclusion that the best way to recompress a sparse matrix with a lot of wasted space is simply to copy it to a new instance.
Because the only data copied will be the data still in use, the result will be a matrix with a smaller footprint.  To aid in this, the Matrix
interface will include a method to retrieve the memory utilization.
